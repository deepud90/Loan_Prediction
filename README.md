# The Loan Prediction Challenge

This project deals with a dataset of the loan applications made to a housing finance company in the past, along with the details of their approval/rejection. The plan is to automate the process of loan approval, and for this we have been asked to use the given data to train an appropriate predictive algorithm. In this work, we shall explore the dataset in detail, clean it, add new features, and do some predictions using machine learning.
More details of the problem, including the problem description and dataset can be obtained from the link below: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/ The given dataset contains a training and test set. It is expected to train the models on the training set, and upload the predictions made on the test set

The ipython notebook file "Loan_Prediction" has a detailed description of the data exploration  as well as prediction done on the dataset.
